<h1> Data structures! </h1>

> What is a data structure?

Data structures, or the "abstract data type" is a collection of primitive data types, there are a few you should know.

Demo code for these can be seen in examples.txt

- Array
    - An array is an immutable, sorted data structure that uses the same primitive type to create a group of ordered, callable data points
    - This data type is often seen in programming languages where you have to explicitly call data types, such as C or Java
    - Data points in an array can be changed during runtime but the size of the array is unchangeable during runtime
- List
    - A list is a mutable, sorted data structure that uses any data type
    - This is often seen in programming languages that use dynamic typing, such as Python and JavaScript, though C++ has libraries for it
    - Like an array, data points can be changed during runtime and the size of the list can change during runtime
- Tuple
    - A tuple is an immutable, unchangable data structure, often used as a constant to store other constants
- Dictionary
    - A dictionary is a data structure made of keys and values, each key is unique but values are not
- Trees
    - A tree is a data structure that consists of a collection of parent nodes and child nodes, trees cannot have more than 2 children per parent (left and right child) and are often called "leaf nodes"
- Graphs
    - A graph is similar to a tree but can have any number of child nodes for a given parent node, and often has a weighting attached to each node
- Linked List
    - A linked list is a data type that contains two pieces of information, its content and a pointer to the next memory address for the linked list, though you can include a third, a pointer to the previous memory address
